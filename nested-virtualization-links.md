## GCP

Enable: [https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/enable-nested-virtualization-vm-instances]

Restrictions:

- Nested virtualization can only be enabled for L1 VMs running on Haswell processors or later. If the default processor for a zone is Sandy Bridge or Ivy Bridge, you can use minimum CPU selection to choose Haswell or later for a particular instance. Review the Regions and Zones page to determine which zones support Haswell or later processors.
- E2 machine types do not support nested virtualization.
- Nested virtualization is supported only for KVM-based hypervisors running on Linux instances. Hyper-V, ESX, and Xen hypervisors are not supported.
- Windows VMs do not support nested virtualization; that is, host VMs must run a Linux OS. However, nested VMs can run certain Windows OSes.
